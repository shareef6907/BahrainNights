🤖 AI is changing SEO. Here's what actually matters in 2026.

After building 50+ websites and watching Google's algorithms evolve, here's what I've learned:

WHAT DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE:
❌ Keyword stuffing
❌ Generic AI-generated content
❌ Link schemes
❌ Thin pages built for bots

WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS:
✅ Genuine expertise in your content
✅ Real user engagement signals
✅ Fast, mobile-first experiences
✅ Fresh, regularly updated content
✅ Local relevance (especially in MENA)

THE AI ANGLE:
We use AI to:
• Speed up research (not replace it)
• Generate first drafts (then heavily edit)
• Analyze competitors at scale
• Automate technical SEO audits

But the STRATEGY? That's human.

Google's getting better at detecting low-effort AI content. The winners will be those who use AI as a tool, not a replacement.
