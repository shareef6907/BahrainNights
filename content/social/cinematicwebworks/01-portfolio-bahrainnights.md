🚀 Case Study: How we built Bahrain's #1 lifestyle platform

When we set out to build BahrainNights.com, the goal was simple: create the go-to resource for everything happening in Bahrain.

THE CHALLENGE:
• Aggregate events from 20+ sources
• Real-time cinema showtimes from 4 cinema chains
• 500+ venue listings with live data
• Mobile-first, lightning fast

THE SOLUTION:
✅ Next.js 15 with React Server Components
✅ Supabase for real-time database
✅ Custom scraping pipelines for event data
✅ Vercel Edge for global performance
✅ SEO-first architecture (80+ indexed guide pages)

THE RESULTS:
📈 15,000+ monthly visitors
⚡ <2 second page loads
🔍 Ranking for 200+ Bahrain keywords
💼 Integrated advertising platform

Building digital products that solve real problems — that's what we do.
