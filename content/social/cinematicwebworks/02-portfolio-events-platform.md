🎪 Building an events empire: The tech behind EventsBahrain.com

Event equipment rental isn't sexy. But the business behind it? That's where it gets interesting.

THE PROBLEM:
Most rental companies in the Gulf rely on WhatsApp quotes and paper invoices. We wanted to change that.

WHAT WE BUILT:
📦 Online equipment catalog with real-time availability
💰 Instant quote calculator
📅 Booking calendar integration
📱 Mobile-optimized for on-site teams
🔗 CRM integration for lead tracking

THE TECH:
• Next.js + TypeScript (fast, SEO-friendly)
• Tailwind CSS (rapid UI development)
• Supabase (real-time inventory updates)
• Vercel (zero-downtime deployments)

THE IMPACT:
• 40% reduction in quote response time
• 3x increase in qualified leads
• Automated follow-ups = more closed deals

Your industry might seem "old school" — but the right tech transforms everything.
