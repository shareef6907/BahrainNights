📸 From photographer to tech CEO — my unconventional path

I never planned to build software companies. I started as a photographer.

THE JOURNEY:

2012: Started as an events photographer
2014: Built my first website (terrible, but it worked)
2016: Launched a video production company
2018: Clients kept asking "can you build us a website too?"
2020: COVID hit. Pivoted hard into digital.
2024: Running 5 interconnected businesses

WHAT I LEARNED:

1️⃣ Skills compound
   Photography → Videography → Web design → Development → AI
   Each skill made the next one easier

2️⃣ Build for yourself first
   BahrainNights started as a personal project. Now it's a platform.

3️⃣ The "boring" problems are the best opportunities
   Event equipment rental? Not sexy. But profitable.

4️⃣ AI is a force multiplier
   I'm a team of one building what used to require 10 people.

Today, Cinematic Group runs:
• Film Production Bahrain (video)
• Events Bahrain (equipment rental)
• BahrainNights (media platform)
• CinematicWebWorks (web development)
• Student Photos (school photography)

The common thread? Creating things that didn't exist before.
