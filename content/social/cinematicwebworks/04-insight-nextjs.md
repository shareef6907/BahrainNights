⚡ Why we build everything with Next.js (and you should too)

5 years ago, we were building WordPress sites. Now? Everything is Next.js. Here's why:

SPEED:
• Server-side rendering = instant first paint
• Static generation = CDN-cached globally
• React Server Components = minimal JS shipped
• Result: <2 second loads on 3G

SEO:
• Full control over meta tags
• Automatic sitemap generation
• Structured data support
• Google loves fast sites

DEVELOPER EXPERIENCE:
• TypeScript out of the box
• File-based routing (no config headaches)
• API routes built-in
• Hot reload that actually works

SCALABILITY:
• Vercel handles traffic spikes automatically
• Edge functions for global performance
• No server management

THE CATCH:
• Steeper learning curve than WordPress
• Need a real developer (that's us 😉)
• Not for simple brochure sites

For serious web applications? There's no competition.
