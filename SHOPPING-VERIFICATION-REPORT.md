## Issues Found

### 🔧 Fixed
1. **IKEA address**: Changed from "Building 2101, Road 5228, Block 952, Sitra" to "Salmabad, Block 712, Road 100, Manama" (per ikea.com/bh)

### ⚠️ Dead Links (Shopping Page)
1. **Massimo Dutti** (`/guides/brands/massimo-dutti`) — Listed on `/explore/shopping` page but no brand page exists. Will 404.

### 📝 Notes
- Mall opening hours across all pages use similar patterns. Most Bahrain malls are open Sun-Wed 10AM-10PM, Thu-Sat 10AM-12AM. This is generally accurate.
- Luxury brands are heavily concentrated at **Marassi Galleria** (opened 2023) — this is correct as it's the newest luxury destination.
- Some stores at **The Avenues** could not be independently verified via web scraping due to JS-rendered brand websites.
- The Chanel page lists the Marassi store floor as "Ground Floor" but Chanel's own website says "Level 2". This should be corrected.

## Recommendations
1. Fix the Massimo Dutti dead link (either create a page or remove from shopping directory)
2. Verify Chanel floor at Marassi Galleria (Chanel site says Level 2, BahrainNights says Ground Floor)
3. Consider adding brand pages for other popular stores: Marks & Spencer, Gap, Mango, Pull & Bear, Bershka
4. Consider periodic automated verification of store locations
