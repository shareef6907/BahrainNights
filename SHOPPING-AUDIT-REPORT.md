## ⚠️ Issues Requiring Updates

### 1. **Store Count Discrepancy - Marassi Galleria**
- **Main page (`/guides/malls`):** "400+ stores"
- **Individual page (`/guides/malls/marassi-galleria`):** "150+ stores"
- **Action:** Fix main page - the individual page has detailed store directory showing ~150 stores
- **Status:** FIXED ✅

### 2. **Location Inconsistency - Bahrain Mall**
- **Main page:** "Sanabis"
- **Individual page:** "Seef District, Manama (near Seef Mall)"
- **Correct:** Bahrain Mall is in Sanabis/Seef area (both are adjacent, Sanabis is more accurate)
- **Action:** Update individual page to match
- **Status:** FIXED ✅

### 3. **Hours Inconsistency - Moda Mall**
- **Main page:** "Sat-Thu 10AM-10PM, Fri 2PM-10PM"
- **Individual page:** "Sat-Wed: 10:00 AM - 10:00 PM, Thu-Fri: 10:00 AM - 12:00 AM"
- **Action:** Need manual verification - Friday hours differ significantly
- **Status:** NEEDS MANUAL VERIFICATION ⚠️

### 4. **Missing Phone Numbers**
- No malls have phone numbers listed
- **Recommendation:** Add phone numbers for each mall
- **Status:** NEEDS MANUAL DATA COLLECTION ⚠️

### 5. **Website URLs - Potentially Broken**
- `modamall.com` - Domain is for sale, not the actual Moda Mall website
- `dragoncity.bh` - Failed to resolve
- `seefmall.com` - Failed to resolve (may be `seefmall.com.bh`)
- `marassigalleria.bh` - Failed to resolve
- **Action:** Verify and update official website URLs
- **Status:** NEEDS MANUAL VERIFICATION ⚠️

### 6. **Moda Mall - Generic Store Listings**
- Individual page uses vague descriptions like "High-end fashion brands" instead of actual store names
- **Action:** Need to get actual store list from official sources
- **Status:** NEEDS ENHANCEMENT ⚠️
